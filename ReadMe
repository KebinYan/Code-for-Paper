Files Explanation:

“Universal R Functions” contain all universal R codes.
 - "Modified Movelet Method" contains the modified movelet method and a write-up document explaining the function logic.
 - "Combine Acc and Gyro Data Using Linear Interpolation.R" takes in an accelerometer dataset and a gyroscope dataset, and returns a combined dataset with gyroscope data interpolated on accelerometer timestamp.
 - "Compare Prediction Graphs.R" contains five functions.
    - "GyroOnAccTime" returns a subset of gyroscope result on accelerometer's timestamp.
    - "RemoveNAs" removes all rows with NAs for their final predictions.
    - "RemoveExtra" removes the extra end point in accelerometer result or in the gyroscope on accelerometer result.
    - "getRevisedData" revises accelerometer, gyroscope, and combined prediction data sets so all three of them have same amount of data on same timestamps.
    - "combinedPlotActivityPrediction" creates a graph comparing true labels, accelerometer predicitons, gyroscope predcitions, and combined data predictions.
 - "Examining Time Difference.R" contains two functions.
    - "CalculateTimeDifference" calculates the time difference between each gyroscope timestamp and the closest accelerometer timestamp.
    - "GraphTimeDifference" plots the time difference for all data points.
 - "Plot Confusion Matrix.R" includes a function to create confusion matrix for a result data set.
 - "Calculate the Amount of Test Data.R" calculates the number of observations for each activity in the test data.
  
"subject1", "subject2", "subject3", and "subject4" have the same format except "subject1" contains training data plots.
  - R scripts: contain R codes applying modified movelet method to each subject's data.
  - Results: 
    - "Confusion Matrices" contains confusion matrices for steps 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and all steps with accelerometer-only, gyroscope-only, and combined data, as well as the R codes to produce these confusion matrices.
    - "Prediction Datasets" contains datasets for steps 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 returned by modified movelet method.
    - "Comparison Graphs" conatins comparison graphs for steps 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, as well as the R codes to produce these comparsion graphs.
  - Test Data: contains test data for steps 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. 
  - Training Data: contains the combined training data on accelerometer timestamps
