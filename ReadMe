Files Explanation:

“Universal R Functions” contain all universal R codes.
 - "Modified Movelet Method" contains the modified movelet method and a write-up document explaining the function logic.
 - "Combine Acc and Gyro Data Using Linear Interpolation.R" takes in an accelerometer dataset and a gyroscope dataset, and returns a combined dataset with gyroscope data interpolated on accelerometer timestamp.
 - "Compare Prediction Graphs.R" contains five functions.
    - "GyroOnAccTime" returns a subset of gyroscope result on accelerometer's timestamp.
    - "RemoveNAs" removes all rows with NAs for their final predictions.
    - "RemoveExtra" removes the extra end point in accelerometer result or in the gyroscope on accelerometer result.
    - "getRevisedData" revises accelerometer, gyroscope, and combined prediction data sets so all three of them have same amount of data on same timestamps.
    - "combinedPlotActivityPrediction" creates a graph comparing true labels, accelerometer predicitons, gyroscope predcitions, and combined data predictions.
 - "Examining Time Difference.R" contains two functions.
    - "CalculateTimeDifference" calculates the time difference between each gyroscope timestamp and the closest accelerometer timestamp.
    - "GraphTimeDifference" plots the time difference for all data points.
 - "Plot Confusion Matrix.R" includes a function to create confusion matrix for a result data set.
 - "Calculate the Amount of Test Data.R" calculates the number of observations for each activity in the test data.
  
"subject1", "subject2", "subject3", and "subject4" have the same format.
  - R scripts: contain R codes applying modified movelet method to each subject's data, creating confusion matrices for each step and all steps together, as well as plotting comparison graphs for each step.
