Function signiture:
  movelet_Bai2012_singleSensor_modified <- function(data, axes, training, frequency, moveletLength, distOption, trainingActivities, useMag)
Input Parameters:
  data: the dataset for analysis (class: data.frame)
  axes: a dataset consists of all time series fitted into the model (class: data.frame)
  training: the training dataset, requring it consisting of only the time series and response label (class: data.frame)
  frequency: data frequency (class: numeric)
  moveletLength: the length of each movelet (class: numeric)
  disOption: the method used to calculate the distance between two data points in two time series (class: character, "L2" or "correlation")
  trainingActivities: a list of all training activities (class: character)
  useMag: if use magnitude (class: logical)
Output:
  A dataset with predictions for data entries
  
Part modified:
  The newMovelet is not extracted from the original dataset but is extracted from the "axes" dataset, so it only consists of the time series data.
  
  
  
Function signiture:
  minDiscrep <- function(newMovelet, activity.training, moveletPoints, distOption, useMag)
Input Parameters:
  newMovelet: the unlabeled movelet, requiring it consisting of only the time series (class: data.frame)
  activity.training: the training dataset for one activity, requires it consisting of only the time series and reponse label at the last column (class: data.frame)
  moveletPoints: the number of points in each movelet, calculated by frequency * moveletLength (class: numeric)
  distOption: the method used to calculate the distance between two data points in two time series (class: character, "L2" or "correlation")
  useMag: if use magnitude (class: logical)
Output:
  A (1 x numActivities) matrix with minimum discrepancy of each activity for each data entry
  
Part modified:
  Create a new matrix variable discrep.temp (dimension: activity.numMovelets x ncol(newMovelet)) to record the discrepancy between the new movelet and each training movelet on each time series.
  Use a for-loop to calculate the discrepancy between the new movelet and each training movelet on each time series, discrepancies stored in discrep.temp.
  The average of each row of the discrep.temp is stored in activity.discrep, which is the discrepancy between the new movelet and each of the training movelet.
